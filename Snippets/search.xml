Using CheckDisk from the Command Line
Open up an administrator mode command prompt, and then type in the following command to do an exhaustive check of your drive. 
Substitute C: for whatever drive you want to check.

chkdsk /f /r C:

If the drive is a system drive or has files in use, you’ll be asked to schedule the check for the next reboot:


To see chkdsk results in Eventlog
================================
right click on the "Application" event log =&gt; Find =&gt; {search for:} chkdsk

To find chkdsk results from PowerShell:
======================================
get-winevent -FilterHashTable @{logname="Application"; id="1001"}| ?{$_.providername –match "wininit"} | fl timecreated, message | out-file Desktop\CHKDSK_SCAN.txt

{Go to your desktop and you should see a file called CHKDSK_SCAN.txt. All the results for your check disk scan will appear in this file}


Notes about results:
===================

EA Records are Extended Attribute records. 
----------
They're a feature of NTFS that allows for a file to have custom extra metadata stored along with it 
(metadata that is not interpretable to the file system). 
EA records are a somewhat obscure feature of NTFS that are used very infrequently, 
but having a few of them doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with your filesystem.

Reparse Records establish Reparse Points within your file system. 
---------------
Reparse Points are a very interesting feature of NTFS that allow a file to be tagged 
with some data that will essentially result in a program (an FS Filter, sort of like a driver)
being run every time you access the file. 
They're not used a lot, most notably they are used to create symlinks in Windows 
(via the mklink command) and for volume mount points 
(this is an obscure feature of Windows that allows you to mount a device as a folder in another device, 
somewhat like the Unix file system). A normal Windows install will have a number of them that are set up by the installer.
