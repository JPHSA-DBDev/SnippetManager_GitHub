https://powerbitalks.com/2021/07/why-microsoft-power-bi-so-slow.html#:~:text=Using%20a%20lot%20of%20images,Power%20BI%20Report%20is%20slower.

Using a lot of images
	, multiple visuals
	, improper DAX formula
	, consuming unnecessary columns into the data model
	, not taking into consideration query folding 
	are some of the reasons due to which Microsoft Power BI Report is slower
	
1] Query Folding 
=============
is the ability of Power Query to generate a single query statement to retrieve and transform source data.	
It is very essential to know whether query folding is taking place for a particular query or not. 
If the native query option is enabled for a query then Query Folding is taking place 
	if not enabled then Query Folding is not taking place.
	
- If you want to do your own SQL plus have PQ fold more stuff, you need to create a view on your server and connect to that, or create ALL transformations in Power Query.
- Using the SQL script box breaks breaks incremental refresh and can cause security issues with gateways not being able to execute the manual statment.

2] Disable the Enable Load Option for a Query
=============================================
Whenever a table is loaded in the form of query in the Power Query then by default 
	enable load option is active and that particular query is loaded into the data model. 
But there are certain tables that act as a supporting table and are not required in the data model.

3] Use Power BI Dataflow instead of Power Query
================================================
Power BI dataflow is available with Premium capacity.
using Power BI dataflow is better for applying transformation steps instead of Power Query for achieving better performance

4] Reduce Number of Images used in the Report
==============================================
 using lot of images in the report reduces the performance of the report and report take a lot of time to render the image. 
 
 5] Reduce number of Visuals in the Report
 ===========================================
 There are two options for one is the use a visual which can replace multiple visuals such 
 	as small multiple visuals in Power BI which is now generally available in July 2021 update. 
 	
 6] Use Star Schema for Better Performance
 =========================================
 best schema for preparing data model on the Power BI side is Star Schema. 
 
7]  Evaluate Custom Visual Performance
=======================================
 it is essential to be cautious while using custom visual into the report.
  
8]Use Optimized DAX Formula
================================

9]Limit Data Model
======================
You can limit the data model by restricting unnecessary columns either at the database level or power query level.

10] Use Measure instead of Calculated Column
==============================================
Measure are calculated on the runtime while calculate column consume memory for processing information

11]Use Variable instead of Measures
==========================================
