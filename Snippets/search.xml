1] EXPLICIT: Actually create a measure, for example:
	TotalSales_Measure = SUM(Sales[SalesAmount])
	{then in a TABLE visual, use TotalSales_Measure, and Manufacturer, to have a table of total sales by Manufacturer}
OR

2] IMPLICIT: create a TABLE visual, use Sales[SalesAmount], and Manufacturer, to have a table of total sales by Manufacturer

  
 Both tables will look the same, but with an EXPLICIT measure you can name it, or format it and it will stay that way wherever you use it.
 	HOWEVER with an IMPLICIT measure it won't retain it's customized name from one visul to another, nor it's format. </Code>
